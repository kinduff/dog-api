# Dog API
This is the Dog API and it provides dog facts as a service dogdog :dog:

## Add to Slack
<a href="https://slack.com/oauth/authorize?scope=incoming-webhook,commands&client_id=2160638498.90708647394"><img alt="Add to Slack" height="40" width="139" src="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png" srcset="https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack.png 1x, https://platform.slack-edge.com/img/add_to_slack@2x.png 2x" /></a>

This will enable two things:

- One daily random fact posted in the channel you select.
- A Slack slash command (`/dogfact`) to retrieve a single fact on any channel.

If installation was successful you'll receive a welcome message :)

### Privacy Policy
Dog Facts is just for fun. The only data retained by Dog Facts is your team webhook url (which is required to post Dog Facts messages to your Slack). Otherwise, no data is kept.

For questions or support, please contact directly through Twitter `https://twitter.com/kinduff` or chat with me at `https://keybase.io/kinduff/chat`

## Use it as an API

**Live endpoint:** `http://dog-api.kinduff.com`

| Path         | Description  | Parameters
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------
| `/api/facts` | Returns an object with dog facts | `?number=5`
| `/api/facts?raw=true` | Returns one fact in plain text 

## Host it yourself
First make sure you have the following dependencies installed.

- Ruby greater than 2.3.0
- SQLite3

Go ahead and clone this repository.

```
git clone git@github.com:kinduff/dog-api.git
```

Then install the dependencies.

```
bundle install
```

After that you'll need to setup your database, run the following command to run migrations and fill out your database with the latest dog facts included in the `db/seeds.rb` file.

```
rake db:setup
```

And finally, start the server by running the following command.

```
rake server
```

Or just `rake` by it self. The application should now be running in `http://localhost:4567`.

In order to run the tests, just run:

```
rake spec
```

## Why you made this?
There's a [Cat API](http://catfacts-api.appspot.com) that returns cat facts. I like cats but I like dogs more. Equilibrium must exists.

Lot's of places, I'll list them tomorrow, mom. Also, special thanks to @screenshotjy and @RoryDuncan for their contributions.
